## This is my repo for learning and discovering Data Science, NLP and Machine Learning.

# Audiobooks - Abstract
The audiobook dataset is a collection of data from the Audiobook app and each
record in the dataset was generated when a customer made at least one purchase.

The main goal of this research is to train a machine learning model by using a
different approach to generate a good model to predict if a customer will make a
purchase again. This model is useful for identifying potential customers who are interested in buying more products. The
maximum accuracy I have reached against the test set is 95.09%.

# Malaria - Abstract
Malaria Dataset is one of the TensorFlow datasets which is taken from the
National Institutes of Health's official website. This dataset is famous because Malaria
Parasite is a dangerous disease that is transmitted by the bite of female Anopheles
mosquitoes. This disease is curable if it is detected and treated promptly.
In this experiment, I will use the dataset of 27,558 records to train the dataset by
using a convolutional neural network. After that, I will try different methods and
determine the best approach to the model.
● Dataset name: ‘malaria’
● Description: The Malaria dataset contains a total of 27,558 cell images with equal
instances of parasitized and uninfected cells from the thin blood smear slide
images of segmented cells
● Dataset size=317.62 MiB
